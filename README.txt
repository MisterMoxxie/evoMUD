Based on Evennia by Griatch


evoMUD is a real-time, 'hack-and-slash' Multi-User Dungeon being developed in Python based on the Evennia engine built by Graitch. The game is currently in the very early stages of planning and pre-alpha development. 

Feel free to check here, the main game website listed above, or drop by in our Freenode IRC channel #evoMUD. The IRC channel is also linked to an in-game chat channel so you can communicate with players wtihout having to connect to the server directly.
